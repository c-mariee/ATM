# ATM

<img src="Screenshot.jpg" alt="ATM">

This project was to create a simple ATM that would allow for functionality of deposit and withdrawal and to continue to maintain a balance. The starter code provided for the format for this and functionality for this tool and I added the following: 
* added the image to the background
* moved the balance to below the buttons
* added the title of "My Account"
* changed the colors of the text
* moved the text and buttons to the center of the page
* changed the color for the field for deposit and withdrawal
* added the dollar sign to hold the space to enter the amount
